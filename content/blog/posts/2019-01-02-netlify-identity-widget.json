Live demo\n\n\n\nFor usage example with React and React Router, please see our /example folder and read the README.\n\n\n\n## What is Netlify Identity\n\nNetlifyâ€™s Identity service is a plug-and-play microservice for handling site functionalities like signups, logins, password recovery, user metadata, and roles. You can use it from single page apps instead of rolling your own, and integrate with any service that understands JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).\n\n\n\nLearn more about this service from this blog post.\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply include the widget on your site, and things like invites, confirmation codes, etc, will start working.\n\n\n\nYou can add controls for the widget with HTML:\n\n\n\n`<!DOCTYPE html>`\n\n`<html>`\n\n`<head>`\n\n`  <title>A static website</title>`\n\n\n\n`  <!-- include the widget -->`\n\n`  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js\"></script>`\n\n`</head>`\n\n`<body>`\n\n`  <!-- Add a menu:`\n\n`   Log in / Sign up - when the user is not logged in`\n\n`   Username / Log out - when the user is logged in`\n\n`  -->`\n\n`  <div data-netlify-identity-menu></div>`\n\n\n\n`  <!-- Add a simpler button:`\n\n`    Simple button that will open the modal.`\n\n`  -->`\n\n`  <div data-netlify-identity-button>Login with Netlify Identity</div>`\n\n`</body>`\n\n`</html>`\n\nThe widget will automatically attach itself to the window object as window.netlifyIdentity."
